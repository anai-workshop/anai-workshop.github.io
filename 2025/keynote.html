                    <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                    Doppler and AoA estimation are fundamental to passive sensing/tracking/localization using narrow-band WiFi/4G/5G wireless signals. Despite various methods proposed, existing approaches remain susceptible to varying interference from multipath and random noise, making robust estimation challenging in indoor environments. This talk introduces a new WiFi-CSI difference paradigm grounded in intuitive insights and rigorous modeling, leading to robust and accurate Doppler and AoA estimation. Specifically, we propose utilizing CSI differences instead of original CSI for sensing parameter estimation, thereby inherently eliminating static multipath interference. Furthermore, our CSI difference model reveals that dynamically tuning the time interval of the differencing operation can significantly reduce the effects of dynamic multipath and random noise. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose the first amplitude-phase fusion scheme to achieve high-precision Doppler estimation; we challenge conventional wisdom on the limits of AoA estimation and develop an iterative phase adjustment scheme to significantly expand the effective estimation range. Extensive real-time and real-world experiments demonstrate that our systems achieve the state-of-the-art performance in Doppler and AoA estimation across diverse environments and targets. We believe the CSI difference paradigm and our proposed methods represent a new milestone in WiFi/4G/5G Doppler and AoA estimation in indoor environments.

                    <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                    Wireless technologies have achieved remarkable success in data communication. In recent years, wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi) have also been leveraged for sensing, enabling exciting applications such as passive localization, contact-free gesture recognition, and vital sign monitoring. Despite this progress, the full potential of wireless sensing remains constrained by several fundamental challenges, including performance degradation under device motion and limited sensing granularity. In this talk, I will present our recent research efforts to address these challenges, focusing on: (i) our theoretical advances that, for the first time, enable robust wireless sensing under device motion; and (ii) a novel sensing modality―quantum wireless sensing―that pushes the boundaries of sensing granularity.
